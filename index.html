        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Genshin Impact (henceforth Genshin) is a RPG (role-playing game) set in a fantastical universe. The player controls a party of 4 adventurers/characters (who they can swap out) and complete quests. Each character can be armed with weapons, and each has a different rank (1 star = common to 5 star = super rare), design aesthetics, and abilities. 
</p>

	<p>Players open up ‘loot boxes’ to obtain characters to play as and weapons to use and progress the story. There are many loot boxes, and these all contain a ‘featured prize’ – a unique 5-star prize that is unique to a particular loot box – which players are often trying to get. The probability of getting characters and weapons are given below (please see this for a full list of rules, but they are not necessary for our limited challenge):

	<p>In order to protect users from overspending, the video game company (Mihoyo) implemented a protection mechanism where:
 
</p>

	<ol>
        <li>If the player doesn’t get a 5-star after opening 90 of the same boxes, the game will gift the player a 5-star character. (coded as pityCount under wishes.csv)
</li>
        <li>If the player doesn’t get a 4-star after opening 10 of the same boxes, the game will gift the player a 4-star character. (coded as rarePity under wishes.csv)
</li>

      </ol>
      
      
      <p>However, rumors are spreading that there are even more mechanisms in place in this lottery. Your goal as a data scientist is to identify if that is really the case, and in the process, find out other anomalies in the data which points to non-disclosed features of the lottery system.
