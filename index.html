        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Genshin Impact (henceforth Genshin) is a RPG (role-playing game) set in a fantastical universe. The player controls a party of 4 adventurers/characters (who they can swap out) and complete quests. Each character can be armed with weapons, and each has a different rank (1 star = common to 5 star = super rare), design aesthetics, and abilities. 
</p>

	<p>Players open up ‘loot boxes’ to obtain characters to play as and weapons to use and progress the story. There are many loot boxes, and these all contain a ‘featured prize’ – a unique 5-star prize that is unique to a particular loot box – which players are often trying to get. The probability of getting characters and weapons are given below (please see this for a full list of rules, but they are not necessary for our limited challenge):
