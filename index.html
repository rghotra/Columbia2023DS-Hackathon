        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Genshin Impact (henceforth Genshin) is a RPG (role-playing game) set in a fantastical universe. The player controls a party of 4 adventurers/characters (who they can swap out) and complete quests. Each character can be armed with weapons, and each has a different rank (1 star = common to 5 star = super rare), design aesthetics, and abilities. 
</p>

	<p>Players open up ‘loot boxes’ to obtain characters to play as and weapons to use and progress the story. There are many loot boxes, and these all contain a ‘featured prize’ – a unique 5-star prize that is unique to a particular loot box – which players are often trying to get. The probability of getting characters and weapons are given below (please see this for a full list of rules, but they are not necessary for our limited challenge):

	<p>In order to protect users from overspending, the video game company (Mihoyo) implemented a protection mechanism where:
 
</p>

	<ol>
        <li>If the player doesn’t get a 5-star after opening 90 of the same boxes, the game will gift the player a 5-star character. (coded as pityCount under wishes.csv)
</li>
        <li>If the player doesn’t get a 4-star after opening 10 of the same boxes, the game will gift the player a 4-star character. (coded as rarePity under wishes.csv)
</li>

      </ol>
      
      
      <p>However, rumors are spreading that there are even more mechanisms in place in this lottery. Your goal as a data scientist is to identify if that is really the case, and in the process, find out other anomalies in the data which points to non-disclosed features of the lottery system.

      <section id="conclusion">
        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>Our analysis shows that there is a hidden pity system that works behind the visible pity system. Once a player reaches 10 pity points, they are far more likely to obtain a legendary item. Before then, obtaining one of these items is nearly impossible. \n Aside from this “soft pity,” Banner ID (type of loot box) and Wish ID (player ID based on individual player factors) are the most important factors in determining probability of obtaining a rare or legendary item. Wish ID is a function that is based on hidden factors, and plays a role in determining loot box chances. Other games with a loot box profit model have given players who spend more money better chances on loot boxes. This is an example of a factor that could play into Wish ID.
